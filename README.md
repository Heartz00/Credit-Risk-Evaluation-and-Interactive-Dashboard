Interactive Visualizations: Visualize the impact of borrower demographics on loan interest rates through scatter plots, histograms, and pie charts.
Heatmap for Loan Amount Distribution: Offers an alternative to histograms with heatmap visualizations to display the loan amount distribution.
Real-Time Data Filtering: The dashboard updates visualizations instantly as filters are applied, offering an interactive user experience.

## Technologies Used:
Python: Main programming language used for data processing and dashboard development.
Dash: Framework for building the interactive web-based dashboard.
Plotly: Used for creating dynamic and responsive data visualizations.
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis.
